query_structure:
  description: This structured query system prioritizes **OTM books as primary sources** for technical and engineering guidance while using **HTA/MTO regulations for legal verification**. The AI should **always reference OTM first** unless the query is strictly legal. 

  default_handling: |
    - If the user query matches multiple topics, prioritize **OTM books first, then HTA/MTO regulations**.
    - If an OTM manual is not listed in the structured query, **fall back to related traffic control principles**.
    - If the query is purely legal in nature (e.g., "What is the penalty for speeding?"), **prioritize HTA statutes** over OTM.

  ai_fallback_handling: |
    - If no direct match is found in OTM books, **return a structured response suggesting a related section**.
    - If the query is regulatory (e.g., "fine for running a red light"), **prioritize HTA/MTO first**.
    - If the query is unclear, **return a clarifying prompt asking for more details** before generating a response.
