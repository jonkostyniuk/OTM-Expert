# Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM) Expert ‚Äì My GPT Implementation

This repository provides a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for creating a custom My GPT model trained to understand and retrieve content from the **Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM)**, the **Highway Traffic Act (HTA)**, and **MTO regulations**. It includes structured YAML references and configuration prompts to enable accurate citation-based responses tailored for transportation engineers, planners, and compliance professionals.

### 1. Clone or Fork the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OTM-Expert-MyGPT.git
```

### 2. Upload Files to My GPT
Upload the following in your My GPT custom configuration:
- `OTM_Expert_Structure.yaml`
- All OTM PDFs you wish to index (e.g., Book 5, 12, 15, 18, 19)
- HTA and MTO regulatory PDFs as listed in the YAML

### 3. Apply Custom Configuration Prompts
Use the `Configuration_Prompts.md` to:
